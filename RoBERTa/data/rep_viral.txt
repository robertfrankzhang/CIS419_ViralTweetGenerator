<BOS>  Dear Ukraine: The Russian military intel community, which has been infected by partisan misinformation, has been wagering on the weakness of Ukrainian President Putin for months. Unless a peaceful ceasefire ends within a few days, America will be back where it was: home alone. Unless all the presidents in Washington become immediately jailed, the mob will occupy and use a systemic coverup as a tool to cover up Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While Presidents Biden and Trudeau have shown the American people that they can overcome their political dysfunction, America must continue to fight against Putin's aggression.
